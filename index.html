          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          This is a tool to aid you in proofreading someone else's work. If you don't have permission
          to edit someone's file, or you simply want to tell them the errors that need to be fixed
          rather than fixing them yourself, you can use this tool to inform them of those errors
          in a nicely-formatted way. Yes, it's simple — but I think it may be faster than having to
          manually copy and paste whatever formatting you are using to display all the errors you've
          found.<br><br>

          <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
          There are two types of "elements" in a Proofreader Helper message — sections and errors.
          This is reflected by the fact that there is a "Next error" button as well as a "Next section"
          button. If the piece of writing you are proofreading is very small, you may only need one section.
          If it contains many different slides, paragraphs, or any other clear sections, you may wish to
          add a section for each of those. After you've added a new section, you can type the name in
          the text box. When you've added a new error, type the original text on the left side, and the
          corrected text on the right side. After you have finished proofreading, click the "Finished" button.
          Then you can copy and paste the corrections in your preferred format.<br><br>

          <h2>Which formats does it provide?</h2>
          Plain text, BBCode, Markdown, Wikitext, HTML, and JSON. If you have a suggestion for a format
          that I missed, please submit an issue on GitHub.<br><br>

          <h2>2.0? Where is 1.0?</h2>
          I was working on another version of this website before I created this one. It was designed a bit
          differently. However, there were some glitches that I was not able to fix, and I was not sure how
          to make it work. Because of that, I rewrote it, and changed several aspects of how it worked.<br><br><br>
